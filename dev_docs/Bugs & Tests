TESTING:
- Case1 in Actionplan (existing exclusive plan)
- does using stairs still cause fov-related crash (when triggering enemy turn)

BUGS
- charge attack will occassionally move past player
- wall_arch can cover same spot (e.g. lichen & chains); feature?
- line breaks break colorization (straightforward but silly workaround would be color-wrapping each word individually)
- menus dont close when exited -> overlapping menus
- walk-blocking containers can be placed on items/doors
    -> exclusive kwarg needs to be implemented
- after using stairs, lctrl keeps registering as 'pressed' (despite not being pressed)
    - pressing lctrl resets key handling properly
    - change to </> to use stairs?
