CURRENT
- Tweak Dungeon generation
    - less empty space
- new spawning functions: create_unique:
    - check each level change if uniques can be spawned
    - remove spawned uniques from dictionary
- Balancing pass for first release
    - chaff monsters much weaker
    - monsters better spread throughout levels
        - maybe increase group sizes in deeper levels?

UPCOMING
- various randomized prefix for architecture
    - e.g. decaying, crumbling, old etc.
- attacking while blocking: shield slam (low damage but chance to daze/stun/push)
    - pushes enemies 1 space away and stuns them for 1 turn (prevents them from closing the gap right away)
    - no damage, only compare STR values? (maybe use shield DEF value as bonus to STR?)
- (e) for empty containers should be dynamic and not added to the name itself
- Monster generator (destroyable)
    - different generator for each monster?
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
    - Queen Boss (immobile, but ranged attack? lays eggs?)
        - randomized special ability (e.g. shield to protect from bombs)
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?
- AI Skill
    - add a randomized aspect when deciding on a cooled down skill
    - add a smart check to make sure no exclusive skills exist at the same delay (??)
- Enemies:
    - Skitter:
        - move skill; gives enemies a chance to move past occupied spots (i.e. get behind player)
    - Smash-attack:
        - Throws 1 spot back (x-tra damage if thrown against wall?)
        - Stuns/Dazes for 1 turn?
        - maybe make seperate throw attack
    - "Suicide": Maybe also add a charge ability, only to be used after its set to explode?
        - add new skill condition: other skill on cooldown/no other skill available
    - "Bombardier" (lobs grenade-like projectile)
    - "Cone": Attacks with cone (can teamkill etc.) (Fire ant?)
    - "Louse": Same as roach, but makes a simple 'hop' every few turns (essentially teleporting 2 steps, can jump over others)
    - "creepy crawlies": cover the floor, need to targeted with fire or AoE
- GUI work
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - Highlight "you" in messages with white color
    Manual
        - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    Menus
        - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
- new static object: steel fence with portcullis parting a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
Light sources
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV
COMBAT
    - reduce ranged damage if enemies are nearby
        - new fighter attr. hindered? similar to surrounded but modifies dmg
Movesets
    - atm further targets take flat half damage (add new modifier to moveset)
    - new weapon: bo-dachi or similar (hits front & back, twirls)
    - new weapon: two-hander
    - new weapon: scythe (reaps r-l, l-r (v.l. dmg), overhead)
    - Ravenous behavior: Will start consuming corpses in FOV
Dungeon
    - map generation takes dlvl into account (dungeon only, dungeon + caves etc., biomes etc)
    - entity placement takes dlvl into account (chance for stronger mobs etc.)
