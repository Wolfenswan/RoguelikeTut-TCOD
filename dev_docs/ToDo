CURRENT
- Update Manual
    - implement dynamic scrolling while at it?
- Tweak Dungeon generation
    - ideally should be a mix between dungeon & tunnels
        - options dungeon (only tunnels & square rooms), caves (only drunk walk), mines (mix of both)
    - use drunk_tunneling to color areas
- Balancing pass for first release
    - chaff monsters much weaker
    - monsters better spread throughout levels
- Queen boss monster
    - maybe allow queen to spit eggs instead of ranged attack?
        - lobbed ranged attack that cant miss?
    - set end state after defeating
    - show final screen after exiting through portal
    - Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
            - maybe protected by queen/boss?
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?

COMBAT
- bombs/projectiles exploding after n turns
- ranged combat
    - add reloadable weapons
        - e.g. crossbow, guns
        - EMPTY indicator in GUI
        - reload by "waiting"
    - some weapons can be fired with enemies nearby
        - e.g. crossbow, guns (but not reloaded)

ENTITIES
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- AI Skill
    - give skills a weight to prefer one over the other
- steel fence with portcullis parting a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
- Light sources
    - static torches/lamps
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV

GUI
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
    Manual
    - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages

REFACTORING/CODE
- can lowering exploration value make a comeback?
- weighted item generation for containers:
    - less chance for each item towards the cap

    - https://oroboro.com/non-uniform-random-numbers/
- rewrite turn_processing lists -> dict
    - write new class "Turn", carrying all relevant information
        - game as owner
        - method end() to clean out turn
        - 'messages' : value list containing all messages to display
