CURRENT
- Tweak Dungeon generation
    - ideally should be a mix between dungeon & tunnels
        - options dungeon (only tunnels & square rooms), caves (only drunk walk), mines (mix of both)
    - use drunk_tunneling to color areas
- Balancing pass for first release
    - chaff monsters much weaker
    - monsters better spread throughout levels
- Queen boss monster
    - maybe allow queen to spit eggs instead of ranged attack?
        - lobbed ranged attack that cant miss?
    - set end state after defeating
    - show final screen after exiting through portal
    - Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
            - maybe protected by queen/boss?
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?

UPCOMING
- rewrite turn_processing lists -> dict
    - write new class "Turn", carrying all relevant information
        - game as owner
        - method end() to clean out turn
        - 'messages' : value list containing all messages to display
- can lowering exploration value make a comeback?
- bombs/projectiles exploding after n turns
- weighted item generation for containers:
    - less chance for each item towards the cap

COMBAT
    - reduce ranged damage if enemies are nearby
        -> new fighter attr. "hindered" similar to surrounded but modifies dmg
            - needs to be displayed in GUI
        -> or simpler: no ranged possible when enemy nearby?
            - not ideal for some ranged weapons; then again neither would be hindered
                - in that case (future!) probably best to apply special rules
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- AI Skill
    x add a randomized aspect when deciding on cooled down skill(s) (35% to ignore skills for now)
    - give skills a weight to prefer one over the other
- GUI work
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - Highlight "you" in messages with white color
    Manual
        - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    Menus
        - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
- new static object: steel fence with portcullis parting a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
Light sources
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV
