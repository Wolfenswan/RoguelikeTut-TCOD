PEP Reminders
- @classmethod when interacting with the class itself
- use else after for loop if loop is supposed to be interrupted by break or return
- use zip() when iterating through two lists
- f'' supports evaluations: f'{True if 0 > 10 else False'}' -> False
- isinstance() when checking type

TESTING:
- Case1 in Actionplan (existing exclusive plan)
- does using stairs still cause fov crash (because it triggers enemy turn)

CURRENT
- tweak panel sizes
    - move status bar into map screen (like qu)
    - maybe set directly on border, render after map_panel has border, add ASCII symbols to better merge it into border
    - experiment with top->down bars?
    - transparency instead of black background if possible (problematic as some bg color in status panel is required for bars/usability etc.)
- Queen boss monster
    - spawn in lowest level
        - either spawn manually or delete from data entries after it has been picked
    - maybe allow queen to spit eggs instead of ranged attack?
        - lobbed ranged attack that cant miss?
- Balancing pass for first release
    - items much rarer
    - monsters better spread throughout levels
        - maybe increase group sizes in lower levels?
- spawning:
    each level outside given spawning range: -10%(20%?) off 100% chance
- waiting->interact
    if standing on same spot as something and not in combat->interact
- dashing into enemies does slightly higher damage (1.25)? maybe add modifier to moveset/data
    - or: tackles for 0.5 damage & dazes
- clear message when effect is applied to player:
    - You are ENTANGLED (w. color)
- unify references to player:
    - either NAME or YOU

UPCOMING
- Monster generator (destroyable)
    - different generator for each monster?
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
    - Queen Boss (immobile, but ranged attack? lays eggs?)
        - randomized special ability (e.g. shield to protect from bombs)
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?
- AI Skill
    - add a randomized aspect when deciding on a cooled down skill
    - add a smart check to make sure no exclusive skills exist at the same delay (??)
- Enemies:
    - Smash-attack:
        - Throws 1 spot back (x-tra damage if thrown against wall?)
        - Stuns/Dazes for 1 turn?
        - maybe make seperate throw attack
    - "Suicide": Maybe also add a charge ability, only to be used after its set to explode?
        - add new skill condition: other skill on cooldown/no other skill available
    - "Bombardier" (lobs grenade-like projectile)
    - "Cone": Attacks with cone (can teamkill etc.) (Fire ant?)
    - "Louse": Same as roach, but makes a simple 'hop' every few turns (essentially teleporting 2 steps, can jump over others)
    - "creepy crawlies": cover the floor, need to targeted with fire or AoE
- GUI work
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - Highlight "you" in messages with white color
    Manual
        - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    Menus
        - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
- new static object: steel fence with portcullis halving a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
Light sources
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV
Movesets
    - atm further targets take flat half damage (add new modifier to moveset)
    - new weapon: bo-dachi or similar (hits front & back, twirls)
    - new weapon: two-hander
Dungeon
    - map generation takes dlvl into account (dungeon only, dungeon + caves etc., biomes etc)
    - entity placement takes dlvl into account (chance for stronger mobs etc.)
