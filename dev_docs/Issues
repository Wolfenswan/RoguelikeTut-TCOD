- menus dont close when exited -> overlapping menus
- odd bug when switching to Cheepicus_8x8x2.png from any other font (background not fully black)
- containers can be placed on doors -> doors are displayed above barrel
- after using stairs, lctrl keeps registering as 'pressed' (despite not being pressed)
    - pressing lctrl resets key handling properly
    - change to </> to use stairs?
- scaling on lower screen sizes needs fixing
	- tweak scaling calculations
		- set only total screen-size in cfg (simple multiplier?), derive other values from there
		- check required min sizes for all panels, scale map panel down as necessary
	- tweak hp/stamina bar sizes (redundant with player panel. good thing?)
- line breaks break colorization (workaround would be color-wrapping each word individually)
