- menus dont close when exited -> overlapping menus
- odd bug when switching to Cheepicus_8x8x2.png from any other font (background not fully black)
- containers can be placed on doors -> doors are displayed above barrel
- after using stairs, lctrl keeps registering as 'pressed' (despite not being pressed)
    - pressing lctrl resets key handling properly
    - change to </> to use stairs?
