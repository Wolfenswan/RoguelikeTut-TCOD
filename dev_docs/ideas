Technical:
- If necessary, reduce the amount of module importing in the data files and work towards easier avoidance of circular
imports
- optional: https://github.com/gamechanger/schemer for dict-validation

Existing features:

Blocking:
    - Should blocking weapons be implemented?
        - e.g. dueling dagger
        - mostly just fluff
        - All checks currently aim at shield/assume blocking is only possible with shield
- Containers
    - Reopen Inventory Window if container is not empty
- Weapons
    - add "head-weapon" (mandibles)
Targeting
    - add "target pos" to results list (so cursor will show at last target)
- Fighting
   - add attack_type to individual moves
   - Should a block reduce the attacker's stamina by an additional ammount?
   - can mantis ogre slam friendly fire?
- Containers
    - ability to add things to containers
    - expand filters so they also accept material filters
    - expand filters to restrict certain levels of craftsmanship/quality?
Spawning
    - set spawning chance in relation to dlvl (chance to spawn outside range, lower the further outside range)
    - alternative dlvls = [(dlvl, weight), (dlvl, weight)] - from dlvl on have that weight
Animation
    - secondary console as overlay to only render animation-stuff
MAP-Generation:
    - djistraks algo to connect stairs as emergency measure?
    - rather than one large drunk-walk, have a small drunk-walk for each generated room?
Options-Window:
    - switch to sort options next to each other instead of below/on top
Menus:
    - Add a 'popup'-switch; if True positioned next to player, else center-screen
    - Or: Popup-next-to switch: passing an entity causes the popup next to the entity
    - display items in more than one row (esp. inventory)
Targeting:
    - Cursor displays area of effect
Skills:
    - verbs defined as list in data (Key.VERBS), then randomly picked from in skill-function
    - tweak skill usage conditions: pre-defined generic conditions, set as tuple of conditions in skills_data
- Generation
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/2y3rkg/faq_friday_7_loot/
- play around with torch noise generation from libtcod sample file

OPTIONAL
Map
    - river, crosses once through map (maybe with source)
    - Biomes, different colored floors/walls, different dungeon algos (cave/dungeon) -> use data files
on-death-trigger
    - e.g. for entangling enemies: entanglement lasts until enemy is killed
breaking free
    - chance to break free from entanglement (compare actor strength? proc every turn with rising chance?)
equipment screen
    - display window for each paperdoll extremity
    - windows only show item name and attributes (but not descr)
    - selecting an item shows full info
Fluff
    - Killing monsters adds to melee_weapon description (blood covered)
    - weapon counts enemies killed with it
    - if gibs land on player, armor gets bloodied description
    - different blood color
- Smartify font selection:
        - auto-create font list from parsing folder
        - set default font in cfg
        - add list to cfg defining which fonts use the rarer layout
- Basic Character Selection
    - Select class
    - Enter Name (use libtcod name list for random selection)
- Magic
    - overcharge system (energy contimatination from inate powers?)
    - hardly discharges on its own, needs to kill enemies to go faster?
- Weapons
    - ranged weapons
        - blocking as usual?
        - off-hand ranged melee_weapon like pistol (how to do dual-wield?)
        - ammo: pouches on belt (optionally for armor?)
        - quiver: part of backpack (new item!)
- add "backpack" equipment-item that replaces the default inventory


New Concept Ideas:
Player Skills
    - if sticking with animal concept, sth. like a tongue attack (chameleon? ant-lion?)
- Monster Generators
    - specified objects in walls/floors to spawn on non-explored/non-visible tiles
    - capped by total monster limit
    - interactable/destroyable? (With specific items?)
- Health
    - Instant Heal potions are very rare
    - Herbs or others can be used outside of combat to promote regeneration(instant heal?)
    - Bigger wounds > More Herbs used
    - Maybe add "herbal pouch" similar to Water bag?
- Water
    - Carry permanent item to store water
    - Can be refilled at fresh water sources (fountains)
    - Can be drunk to restore Stamina
    - Can be drunk during combat if offhand is free.
    - % filled indicated on player status panel
- On Monster Death
    - Drop Equipped/Carried Items
    - drop a "loot bag" container instead of individual items to avoid clutter (deleted if empty)
- AI
    - Ravenous behavior: Will start consuming corpses in FOV
- GUI
    - draw ent description to enemy panel instead of popup?

    - windows can remain open? see options_menu for example
- MAP
    - zig-zagging tunnels rather than only v then h or h then v
- Puzzle-Room
    - "Paint" with corpses
