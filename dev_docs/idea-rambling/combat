# General
   - add attack_type to individual moves
   - Should a block reduce the attacker's stamina by an additional ammount?
# Targeting
    - add "target pos" to results list (so cursor will show at last target)
# Blocking:
    - blocking weapons?
        - e.g. dueling dagger
        - mostly just fluff
        - All checks currently aim at shield/assume blocking is only possible with shield
    - attacking while blocking: shield slam (low damage but chance to daze/stun/push)
        - pushes enemies 1 space away and stuns them for 1 turn (prevents them from closing the gap right away)
        - no damage, only compare STR values? (maybe use shield DEF value as bonus to STR?)

# Movesets
- atm further targets take flat half damage (add new modifier to moveset)
