PEP Reminders
- @classmethod when interacting with the class itself
- use else after for loop if loop is supposed to be interrupted by break or return
- use zip() when iterating through two lists
- f'' supports evaluations: f'{True if 0 > 10 else False'}' -> False
- isinstance() when checking type

TESTING:
- Case1 in Actionplan (existing exclusive plan)

CURRENT
- Monster generator (destroyable)
    - different generator for each monster?


UPCOMING
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
    - Queen Boss (immobile, but ranged attack? lays eggs?)
        - randomized special ability (e.g. shield to protect from bombs)
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?
- AI Skill
    - add a randomized aspect when deciding on a cooled down skill
    - add a smart check to make sure no exclusive skills exist at the same delay (??)
- Enemies:
    - Smash-attack:
        - Throws 1 spot back (x-tra damage if thrown against wall?)
        - Stuns/Dazes for 1 turn?
        - maybe make seperate throw attack
    - "Suicide": Maybe also add a charge ability, only to be used after its set to explode?
        - add new skill condition: other skill on cooldown/no other skill available
    - "Bombardier" (lobs grenade-like projectile)
    - "Cone": Attacks with cone (can teamkill etc.) (Fire ant?)
    - "Louse": Same as roach, but makes a simple 'hop' every few turns (essentially teleporting 2 steps, can jump over others)
    - "creepy crawlies": cover the floor, need to targeted with fire or AoE
- GUI work
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - Highlight "you" in messages with white color
    Manual
        - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    Menus
        - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
- new static object: steel fence with portcullis halving a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
Light sources
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV
Movesets
    - atm further targets take flat half damage (add new modifier to moveset)
    - new weapon: bo-dachi or similar (hits front & back, twirls)
    - new weapon: two-hander
Dungeon
    - map generation takes dlvl into account (dungeon only, dungeon + caves etc., biomes etc)
    - entity placement takes dlvl into account (chance for stronger mobs etc.)
