Bugs/Known Issues:
- qu items are not moved to inventory when removing equipment with qu slots?
- hitting additional targets ignores their blocking status
- menus dont close when exited -> overlapping menus
- odd bug when switching to Cheepicus_8x8x2.png from any other font (background not fully black)
- containers can be placed on doors -> doors are displayed above barrel
- odd black spots when opening menus (rendering related?)
- after using stairs, lctrl keeps registering as 'pressed' (despite not being pressed)
    - pressing lctrl resets key handling properly
    - change to </> to use stairs?


PEP Reminders
- @classmethod when interacting with the class itself
- use else after for loop if loop is supposed to be interrupted by break or return
- use zip() when iterating through two lists
- f'' supports evaluations: f'{True if 0 > 10 else False'}' -> False
- isinstance() when checking type

TESTING:
- Case1 in Actionplan (existing exclusive plan)

CURRENT
- Monster generator (destroyable)
    - different generator for each monster?


UPCOMING
- Ent Placement
    - Implement the 'exclusive' switch to find_end_position to make sure e.g. chests and barrels are on their own
- Basic Goals
    - Generate "goal architecture" (at the lowest level?) (pre-fab rooms later)
        - needs to be destroyed with black powder bomb
    - Queen Boss (immobile, but ranged attack? lays eggs?)
        - randomized special ability (e.g. shield to protect from bombs)
    - Items to retrieve (take up spot in inventory)
    - has to return to portal?
- AI Skill
    - add a randomized aspect when deciding on a cooled down skill
    - add a smart check to make sure no exclusive skills exist at the same delay (??)
- Enemies:
    - Smash-attack:
        - Throws 1 spot back (x-tra damage if thrown against wall?)
        - Stuns/Dazes for 1 turn?
        - maybe make seperate throw attack
    - "Suicide": Maybe also add a charge ability, only to be used after its set to explode?
        - add new skill condition: other skill on cooldown/no other skill available
    - "Bombardier" (lobs grenade-like projectile)
    - "Cone": Attacks with cone (can teamkill etc.) (Fire ant?)
    - "Louse": Same as roach, but makes a simple 'hop' every few turns (essentially teleporting 2 steps, can jump over others)
    - "creepy crawlies": cover the floor, need to targeted with fire or AoE
- GUI work
    - messages displaying same information should be merged (using counters: 'x2')
    - Highlight "you" in messages with white color
    Manual
        - Dynamic scrolling, instead of predefined pages
    Menus
        - allow pages in menus, change via left/right or up/down
- new static object: steel fence with portcullis halving a room
    - does block walk but not sight/projectile
Light sources
    - add light_source component to entity
    - if range of light_source is in player's FOV, add that area to FOV
Movesets
    - atm further targets take flat half damage (add new modifier to moveset)
    - new weapon: bo-dachi or similar (hits front & back, twirls)
    - new weapon: two-hander
Dungeon
    - map generation takes dlvl into account (dungeon only, dungeon + caves etc., biomes etc)
    - entity placement takes dlvl into account (chance for stronger mobs etc.)


New Concept Ideas:
Player Skill
    - TONGUE (Antlion/Chameleon)
- Monster Generators
    - specified objects in walls/floors to spawn on non-explored/non-visible tiles
    - capped by total monster limit
    - interactable/destroyable? (With specific items?)
- Health
    - Instant Heal potions are very rare
    - Herbs or others can be used outside of combat to promote regeneration(instant heal?)
    - Bigger wounds > More Herbs used
    - Maybe add "herbal pouch" similar to Water bag?
- Water
    - Carry permanent item to store water
    - Can be refilled at fresh water sources (fountains)
    - Can be drunk to restore Stamina
    - Can be drunk during combat if offhand is free.
    - % filled indicated on player status panel
- On Monster Death
    - Drop Equipped/Carried Items
    - drop a "loot bag" container instead of individual items to avoid clutter (deleted if empty)
- AI
    - Ravenous behavior: Will start consuming corpses in FOV
- GUI
    - draw ent description to enemy panel instead of popup?

    - windows can remain open? see options_menu for example
- MAP
    - zig-zagging tunnels rather than only v then h or h then v
- Puzzle-Room
    - "Paint" with corpses

Existing features:
Blocking:
    - Should blocking weapons be implemented?
        - e.g. dueling dagger
        - mostly just fluff
        - All checks currently aim at shield/assume blocking is only possible with shield
- Containers
    - Reopen Inventory Window if container is not empty
- Weapons
    - add "head-weapon" (mandibles)
Targeting
    - add "target pos" to results list (so cursor will show at last target)
- Fighting
   - add attack_type to individual moves
   - Should a block reduce the attacker's stamina by an additional ammount?
   - can mantis ogre slam friendly fire?
- Containers
    - ability to add things to containers
    - expand filters so they also accept material filters
    - expand filters to restrict certain levels of craftsmanship/quality?
Spawning
    - set spawning chance in relation to dlvl (chance to spawn outside range, lower the further outside range)
    - alternative dlvls = [(dlvl, weight), (dlvl, weight)] - from dlvl on have that weight
Animation
    - secondary console as overlay to only render animation-stuff
MAP-Generation:
    - djistraks algo to connect stairs as emergency measure?
    - rather than one large drunk-walk, have a small drunk-walk for each generated room?
Options-Window:
    - switch to sort options next to each other instead of below/on top
Menus:
    - Add a 'popup'-switch; if True positioned next to player, else center-screen
    - Or: Popup-next-to switch: passing an entity causes the popup next to the entity
    - display items in more than one row (esp. inventory)
Targeting:
    - Cursor displays area of effect
Skills:
    - verbs defined as list in data (Key.VERBS), then randomly picked from in skill-function
    - tweak skill usage conditions: pre-defined generic conditions, set as tuple of conditions in skills_data
- Generation
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/2y3rkg/faq_friday_7_loot/
- play around with torch noise generation from libtcod sample file

OPTIONAL
Map
    - river, crosses once through map (maybe with source)
    - Biomes, different colored floors/walls, different dungeon algos (cave/dungeon) -> use data files
on-death-trigger
    - e.g. for entangling enemies: entanglement lasts until enemy is killed
breaking free
    - chance to break free from entanglement (compare actor strength? proc every turn with rising chance?)
equipment screen
    - display window for each paperdoll extremity
    - windows only show item name and attributes (but not descr)
    - selecting an item shows full info
Fluff
    - Killing monsters adds to melee_weapon description (blood covered)
    - weapon counts enemies killed with it
    - if gibs land on player, armor gets bloodied description
    - different blood color
- Smartify font selection:
        - auto-create font list from parsing folder
        - set default font in cfg
        - add list to cfg defining which fonts use the rarer layout
- Basic Character Selection
    - Select class
    - Enter Name (use libtcod name list for random selection)
- Magic
    - overcharge system (energy contimatination from inate powers?)
    - hardly discharges on its own, needs to kill enemies to go faster?
- Weapons
    - ranged weapons
        - blocking as usual?
        - off-hand ranged melee_weapon like pistol (how to do dual-wield?)
        - ammo: pouches on belt (optionally for armor?)
        - quiver: part of backpack (new item!)
- add "backpack" equipment-item that replaces the default inventory
